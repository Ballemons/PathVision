# PathVision

A Python tool for visualising the Bellman-Ford algorithm in action over a variety of best-path algebras. At the moment it allows you to interactively edit graphs and then step backwards and forwards through time to track how the state changes at each iteration. It may well be buggy, feel free to open an issue if you encounter one.
